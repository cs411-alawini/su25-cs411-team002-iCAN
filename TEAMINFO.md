## Project Summary

A Pokémon boss rush where you battle custom gym leaders!!

Pokémon Boss Rush is a strategy-first, database-driven single player role-playing game designed for the web. Our app removes the time-consuming exploration of traditional Pokémon games and focuses on the experience of team building and strategic battles. Players will create a user profile, access a Pokédex to build a team of six Pokémon, and customize their movesets to prepare them for battle. The core feature of the game is a boss rush. A boss rush is a challenging rogue-like where players must defeat a series of four unique gym leaders in a single run. 

This project provides a curated experience that fills a very specific niche for Pokémon fans. It allows for strategic experimentation and roleplaying without the high-stakes pressure of competitive player-vs-player battle simulators and the need for hours of in-game exploration of the main game. The Gym Leaders introduce a creative aspect of this app, where each has a distinct personality, appearance and battle AI modeled after a member of our development team.
